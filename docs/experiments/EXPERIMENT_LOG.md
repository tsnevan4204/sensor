# Experiment log

Newest entries go at the bottom. E000–E007 were reconstructed from the original chat sessions (Nov 3–6, 2026).

## E000 — Simulated world + reference solver  (2026-11-05)
**Change:** `wall_toy.py`: Debye water, CRIM mixing, transfer-matrix reference, radar model, range-profile baseline.
**Gates:** TMM vs half-space formula and Airy slab formula: exact; |Γ| ≤ 1 on all scenes.
**Results:** range profile cannot resolve drywall (optical 2.05 cm < 3.75 cm resolution). 5% wet insulation erases the back-wall echo. The graded-moisture scene produces a −33 dB false sidelobe peak.
**Next:** DEC forward model.

## E001 — Standard vs exact Hodge stars  (2026-11-05)
**Hypothesis:** exact (Trefftz) stars make the 1D DEC exact with one cell per layer.
**Change:** `exact_hodge.py`.
**Results:** exact stars at 4 nodes match the TMM (initially reported as 2.7e-10; see E004). Standard stars: 160 cells/layer gives 4.7e-2 error; 640 cells/layer gives 1.5e-2.
**Conclusion:** accepted. The standard star's phase error (κ−k ≈ k(kℓ)²/24) accumulates over about 300 rad of round-trip phase.

## E002 — Vectorized exact-star forward + adjoint Jacobian  (2026-11-05)
**Change:** `wall_inverse.forward`: a tridiagonal (Thomas) solve vectorized over frequencies, residual-checked with a LAPACK pivoting fallback; adjoint with a second right-hand side; analytic derivatives of the stars and CRIM.
**Gates:** adjoint vs FD relative difference ~2e-8 to 2e-7. Forward + Jacobian about 17 ms at 256 frequencies.
**Note:** wet insulation makes the back-wall Jacobian ~1e-14 (invisible). The first FD check "failed" only because both values were zero.

## E003 — Calibration + random multistart LM  (2026-11-05)
**Results:** 105 s; 23 of 24 starts converged to a wrong wall (χ² 1118 vs about 512 expected). Cycle skipping.
**Conclusion:** rejected as a global strategy.

## E004 — μ₀ constant bug  (2026-11-05)
**Finding:** the 1e-10 residual came from μ₀ = 4π·1e-7 used with η₀ = 376.730313668 (2019 SI mismatch), not round-off. With μ₀ = η₀/c the forward model matches to 3e-15.

## E005 — Time-gated layer stripping + cycle hopping + parameter tying  (2026-11-05)
**Results:**
- Untied, χ² = 447 ≈ noise, yet two parameters were about 7 CRB off. A genuine ambiguity: the alternative wall's prediction differs by 0.0014 rms, below the noise of 0.007.
- With drywall εr/tan δ tied: the back drywall t shows a discrete ambiguity, with ±k·1.17 mm basins all within Δχ² < 4.
**Change:** `Gate`, `Stage`, `strip_invert`, `cycle_hop`, `ambiguity_scan`, `P.tie`.
**Conclusion:** report plausible-basin sets, not a single number.

## E006 — Wet insulation (L2)  (2026-11-06)
**Findings:**
- θ was held fixed in the gated front stage, so the fit landed in a wrong basin (χ² 1107 vs truth 434). Fixed by putting θ in that stage.
- Then a physical degeneracy: θ = 0.20 fits as well as 0.05.
- Fix: a differential measurement, with the front drywall known from a dry-patch scan.
- Standoff lattice spaced a whole period could miss the basin. Fixed with quarter-period standoff starts.
- Benchmark truths at nominal flattered the method. Randomized via `scenarios.truth_random`.

## E007 — Full validation  (2026-11-06)
**First run:** only 3 of 10 random dry walls fit to noise. Cause: the range-peak standoff guess was off by up to 6 mm, outside the ±3 mm bounds. Fix: ±10 mm bounds plus exact standoff profiling (`best_standoff`).
**Final run:** see `docs/06_findings_so_far.md` and `results/2026-11-06_E007_validation/`.
- 9 of 10 at noise level; the failure was flagged (χ²/n = 1.58).
- Back drywall: 3–5 plausible basins; the truth was inside the set in 9 of 10.
- L2 with a known front: θ = 0.0500 ± 0.0011.
- Host εr mismatch: +20% bias.
- L3 profile: about one identifiable number.
**Compute:** about 85 s per L1 inversion. **Main target for the next experiments.**
**Next:** roadmap Phase 1 item 1 (cut search cost to ≤ 1 s), then item 2 (unknown layer count, B5-family benchmark).

## E008 — Honest benchmark B1-dry-v2: loss tangents randomized, basin-joint scoring  (2026-11-09)
**Roadmap item:** benchmark integrity (prerequisite for Phase 1.1). Benchmark-only change: the method is not modified.
**Why:** in B1-dry-v1 (`truth_random`) the true tan δ of drywall and insulation equal the model's fixed nominal values, so loss is known exactly; this violates "starting guesses must not equal the truth". Fisher check at the nominal wall: freeing tan δ raises the insulation-t CRB from 0.29 mm to 1.8 mm and insulation-εr from 0.0074 to 0.047. Also the E007 "truth inside plausible set" test used a fixed 0.3 mm window per thickness, which for the insulation tests a point on a continuous t/εr ridge, not a basin, and it checked parameters one at a time, not jointly.
**Hypothesis (written before the runs):** on v2 the E007 method with tan δ estimated will (a) still fit to noise (χ²/n ≤ 1.2) in ≥ 90% of runs, but (b) its insulation t/εr errors grow ~6× (CRB-consistent), and (c) the joint truth-in-set rate drops below the v1 rate because the ambiguity scan only hops one parameter at a time. With tan δ held at nominal (now wrong), χ²/n rises and errors become biased.
**Change:**
- `scenarios.truth_random_v2`: tan δ drywall ~ U(0.015, 0.045), fiberglass ~ U(0.005, 0.02) (assumed literature ranges), other draws as v1.
- `benchmark.py` (new): data generation, a method registry, one scorer for all methods. Outcomes: success (χ²/n ≤ 1.2 and truth in plausible set), flagged (χ²/n > 1.2), silent (χ²/n ≤ 1.2, truth outside). Truth in set = some plausible basin (Δχ² < 4) has every layer's optical thickness Re(n)·t within λc/4 of the truth (same phase basin in all layers jointly). err/CRB also in optical thickness. χ² at the truth recorded. Compute = wall time per inversion on 1 core (BLAS threads = 1) and forward-solve counts.
- `wall_inverse.ambiguity_scan(..., return_models=False)`: optional return of the full plausible basin models (default behaviour unchanged).

### Pre-registered hypotheses for E009–E012 (written 2026-11-09, before any benchmark run of these methods)
All on B1-dry-v2 seeds 1–20 (tan δ free), each compared with the previous accepted method. Compute is reported as *work* = Σ forward solves × (frequencies / 256), which does not depend on machine load. Wall time is also reported, but this machine is shared with a background agent.
- **E009** (search LMs on every 8th frequency, early stop at Δχ² < 0.01; the 3 best distinct basins and every competitive hop re-converged on all 256 frequencies at tol 1e-12): work ≥ 4× lower than e007_tanfree, outcome counts (success / flagged / silent) within ±1 seed.
- **E010** (matrix-pencil seeding of the front-drywall stage: 9 starts on the measured τ ridge instead of 51 lattice starts; window ±2 periods set from held-out calibration seeds 1001–1050): work ≥ 1.5× lower than E009, outcomes within ±1 seed.
- **E011** (LM in optical coordinates τ = Re(n)·t): median LM iterations per run ≥ 30% lower, outcomes not worse.
- **E012** (integer least squares over joint period shifts of standoff and all thicknesses, candidates from a fitted quadratic, every candidate verified by a profiled LM): silent failures fewer than E011 (target 0); the reported P(best basin) is calibrated, i.e. its mean is within ±0.15 of the observed rate at which the best basin is the truth's; work ≤ 2× E011.
